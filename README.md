# JDFTxScripts
I'm beginning to use JDFTx to model plasmonic optoelectronic devices. I intend to share my scripts and any useful notes I produce to facilitate others modeling these devices using the NESSE framwork.  (I did not develop the NESSE framework and the original publication can be found here:https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.3.075201)

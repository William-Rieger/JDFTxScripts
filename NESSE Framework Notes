The NESSE Framework requires multiple inputs from JDFTx.

They are as follows:

For hot carrier generation

  1) fkn and fkn' 
      These are the ocupations of the states kn and kn'. These are computed using the jdftx exicutible. 
  2) Ekn and Ekn' 
      These are the energies of the states kn and kn'. Theae are computed using the jdftx esicutable. 
  3) <p>k n n'
      This is the momentime matrix where each element is <kn|p|kn'> it is important to note that this is a complex 3-vector, and is hence represented by six numbers in the momentum dump file. So the total number of floats is nStates^2*6. This matrix is calculated from the jdftx exicutible. 
  4) nk'-k,alpha
      This is the Bose occupation indexed by wave vector k'-k and polarization alpha. This comes from the phonon exicutible.
  5) hbar omega k'-k, aplha
      This is the phonon energy for a phonon indexed by wave vector k'-k and polarization alphs. This comes from the phonon exicutible.
  6) g k'-k,alpha k'n', kn1
      This is the momentum matrix for electron-phonon interactions. It must come from the phonon exicutible but I'm not yet sure how to accomplish this.
     
 For scattering matrix
 
  1) Same as above
  2) G
      reciprical lattice vectors
  3) rho tilda k'n',kn
      still not fully understood by me.
  4) epsilon^-1 GG'
      This is the inverse dielectric tensor, it comes from the random phase approsimation but I dont understand how to do this yet.
